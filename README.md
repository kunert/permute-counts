# Optimized Permutation Testing

Code to accompany the paper "Optimized Permutation Testing for Information Theoretic Measures of Multi-Gene Interactions" by Kunert-Graf, Sakhanenko and Galas.

This consists of two self-contained jupyter notebooks, "plot_computational_complexity" and "plot_transformed_distributions", which generate the accompanying figures.
